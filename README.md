### my bio 
Hello there my name is Andr√© Guilherme 
,i'm a indie game developer/engine programmer started my carrer
in 2020/2021 while i was trying to study to mod the open ps2 loader 
on the time i've learned c++(my mistake but it's a good one) and then
i gave up and so i used to program some source ports like these ones:
[Doom64EX-Plus](https://github.com/atsb/Doom64EX-Plus)
[Wolf4SDL](https://github.com/Doom-modding-and-etc/Wolf4SDL)
[glDoom](https://github.com/atsb/glDoom)
[ps2doom](https://github.com/Doom-modding-and-etc/ps2doom)
[doomgeneric-ps2](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/doomgeneric-ps2)
and i worked with: [Tyra Engine](https://github.com/h4570/tyra), 
id tech 0, id tech 1, HPL1 Engine and a few tools
I use C 80% in projects due to it's compatbility 
and easy maintence compared to c++.
I like in my freetime sometimes remaster some old movies
tv programs with some modernized audio and i like
in my free time i also port some Video games such as
ps2(prefered), xbox and etc.

Bonus: ~~i'm redpill/fatalist boy~~
