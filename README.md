### My Biography 
Hello there my name is Andr√© Guilherme, i'm a brazilian indie game developer/engine programmer, i
started my carrer on 2020/2021 while i was trying to study the open ps2 loader 
to create some lib that supports exfat or ext4 on linux but i miserably failed
on the time i've learned C++ Language(my mistake) and then
i gave up but i used to program some source ports like these ones:
[Doom64EX-Plus](https://github.com/atsb/Doom64EX-Plus),
[Wolf4SDL](https://github.com/Doom-modding-and-etc/Wolf4SDL),
[glDoom](https://github.com/atsb/glDoom),
[ps2doom](https://github.com/Doom-modding-and-etc/ps2doom),
[doomgeneric-ps2](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/doomgeneric-ps2),
[Tyra Engine](https://github.com/h4570/tyra), 
id tech 0, id tech 1, HPL1/HPL2 Engine and a few tools
I use C most of the time C89 or K&R in the projects due to it's compatbility 
and easy maintence compared to C++.
I like in my freetime sometimes remaster some old movies,
tv programs with some modernized audio and
in my free time, i port some apps to consoles such as
PS2(prefered), OG Xbox and etc.
